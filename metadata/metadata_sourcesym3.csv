Two separate species distribution models (SDM) were created. The first was a model of all species in the Delphinidae family classified by the IUCN as critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable. The second was a model of all species in the Delphinidae family. All predictions below 0.5 (bottom 50%) were removed from the second model (all species). 0.5 was then subtracted from the second model so that the values for all species ranged between 0 and 0.5, and the values for threatened species ranged between 0 and 1. The two models were then added together. As such, a value of 0.5 can represent the highest probability for all species, or a 50% probability for threatened species. A value of 1.5 represent the highest probability for all and threatened species.",Ecosystem components (e.g. habitat and species),SPECIES,https://obis.org/manual/accessr/,OBIS (2022) Ocean Biodiversity Information System.
